# Image-Recognition-AI
A neural network I trained without any modules like pytorch or keras

# Information ℹ
Very similar to my [Tic Tac Toe Neural Network](https://github.com/TheonlyIcebear/Tic-Tac-Toe-Machine-Learning)

I trained it using a large dataset of images 

# Usage ⚙

You can run `main.py` however you'd like, to change the paramaters go to the bottom of the file and change the paramaters going to `Main`

### Arguements
 > Tests:<br> 
 > - How many times trials each thread will face the model against the training bot<br>

 > Momentum Conservation
 > - The percent of the old gradient descent that is added to the current gradient descent

 > Learning Rate:<br>
 > - This changes how much and how quickly the model changes. The higher the faster but it may actually miss it's target's value and fail to actually train effectively.

 > Dimensions:<br>
 > - The amount of layers in the model and the amount of nodes within each layer.

 > Threads:<br>
 > - How many CPU Threads the program will use for training

To test the model run play.py, you can enter your own image link or have it pick a random image to classify
